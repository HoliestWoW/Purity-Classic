# Purity Challenge AddOn for World of Warcraft

Purity is a hardcore challenge addon for World of Warcraft that allows players to opt into strict, class-specific and global challenges. These challenges are designed to be completed from level 1 to 60 (or the current level cap), testing your knowledge of the game and forcing you to play in new and interesting ways.

The addon is lightweight, modular, and designed to provide a verifiable path for proving your accomplishment.
